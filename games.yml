  title: A Good Snowman is Hard to Build
  tagline: So I laid down to sleep.
  author: Alan Hazelden and Benjamin Davis
  description: "I was expecting this game to provide me with some very clever
  snow-pushing puzzles and Eureka moments, and it definitely delivered. I wasn't
  so much expecting to feel as touched (and occasionally disturbed) as I was by the
  game's character and setting. In its short (but dense) playtime, A Good Snowman
  manages to carve itself the kind of mysterious little world whose walls you're
  desperate to climb over."

  title: The Swapper
  tagline: So beautiful I had to keep stopping to look.
  author: Facepalm Games
  description: "In the mold of [Braid](http://braid-game.com/) or
  [Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)): a genuinely new
  concept, eureka-inducing puzzles, and a commitment to go the extra mile. Made by a
  couple of people from Helsinki who were no good at polygons, so its art is made
  almost entirely from physical materials. The story is challenging, menacing,
  and philosophical, in the best science fiction tradition. Easily my favorite
  game of 2013."

- slug: little-inferno
  title: Little Inferno
  tagline: Burn it all down
  author: Tomorrow Corporation
  description: "Simple premise: burn things in a fireplace, buy more things to
  burn with the money you made from burning things. Keep buying and burning and
  get strange letters to jaunty '40s-era swing music. A biting, funny
  satire with terrific writing and a very unexpected ending. More here than
  meets the eye."

  title: Redder
  tagline: Take what you need.

  description: "A lonely little puzzle game by [anna anthropy](http://www.patreon.com/queenofspace)
  I've kept thinking about for years, Redder is an understated descent into madness. An open-ended, claustrophobic
  explorer to find the resources you need, and maybe the resources you want.
  One haunting song plays on loop the whole short time, maybe 2 hours. I could
  have played and listened for 10."

- slug: fez
  title: Fez
  tagline: Finding the cracks in the universe
  description: "Fez is made for people who love feeling as if they've stumbled
  onto something secret and of terrible importance. With your companion hypercube,
  you flatten 3D into 2D, explore the folds of space, and decipher puzzles spread
  across the entire game. Numbers, music, and treasure maps are taken very seriously.
  It's difficult to convey how good Fez is from screens or short videos. Fez's creator
  is the definition of a perfectionist, and Fez is the perfect definition of
  a game greater than the sum of its parts."
